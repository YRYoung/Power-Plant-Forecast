# Time Series Library (TSlib)
TSlib is an open-source library for deep learning researchers, especially deep time series analysis.

We provide a neat code base to evaluate advanced deep time series models or develop your own model, which covers five mainstream tasks: **long- and short-term forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification.**


**Compared models of this leaderboard.** ☑ means that their codes have already been included in this repo.

## Usage

1. Install Python 3.8. For convenience, execute the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtained the well pre-processed datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Cg1KYOlzM5C7K8gK8NfC-F3EYxkM3D2?usp=sharing), [[Tsinghua Cloud]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/84fbc752d0e94980a610/) or [[Baidu Drive]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r3KhGd0Q9PJIUZdfEYoymg?pwd=i9iy). Then place the downloaded data under the folder `./dataset`. Here is a summary of supported datasets.

3. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```
# long-term forecast
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/ETT_script/TimesNet_ETTh1.sh


4. Develop your own model.

- Add the model file to the folder `./models`. You can follow the `./models/Transformer.py`.
- Include the newly added model in the `Exp_Basic.model_dict` of  `./exp/exp_basic.py`.
- Create the corresponding scripts under the folder `./scripts`.
